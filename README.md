# Python Battlefield Simulator

This project is a work in progress.

I started this project as a way for me to learn to develop in python.
I took a project that I had worked on in college that was designed to teach us object oriented programming in java and decided to port it.
Some aspect from the original are still missing such as sprites for characters and saving results.


* Run from the main folder of the project the command `python3 src/Simulator.py` (may not work, workaround, pull the project into pycharm and run there.)
* My original version had no unit tests. This version does and can be ran with this command from the main folder: `pytest test/*`

# Dependencies:
Ensure Tinker TK is installed.
* To have QT5 Gui run install: `pip install pyqt5`
* To have the scatter plot work install: `pip install matplotlib`
* To run test install: `pip install pytest`
